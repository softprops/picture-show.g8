# Picture Show g8 template

A [g8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8#readme) template for [picture show](http://github.com/softprops/picture-show/) presentations

Includes the bare minimum [config](https://github.com/softprops/picture-show.g8/blob/master/src/main/g8/conf.js) file to get a presentation started.

To add add custom styles or behavior a blank file has been added [here](https://github.com/softprops/picture-show.g8/blob/master/src/main/g8/css/custom.css) and [here](https://github.com/softprops/picture-show.g8/blob/master/src/main/g8/js/custom.js).

Any styles or javascript in those files will override picture show's default.

Generate a local show after installing [g8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8#readme) with the following command

    g8 softprops/picture-show
